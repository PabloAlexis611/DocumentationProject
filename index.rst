Welcome to Coding with Kids!
============================
Coding with kids can be a *great*
way to not only teach them some skills
that will help them with their
own lives, but will also
*create or strengthen* some lasting
**bonds between you and them.**

Throughout your journey you will
both likely learn new ``concepts`` and
``terms`` that will expand your horizons
and provide hours of enjoyment.
